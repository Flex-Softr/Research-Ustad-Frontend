# Frontend Endpoint Updates

## Summary
Updated frontend to use new consolidated backend endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Research Members Service
- **File**: `src/services/reserarchers/index.ts`
- **New endpoints**: `/users/research-members/*`
- **Legacy endpoints**: `/researchAssociate/*` (still work via backend redirect)

### 2. New Configuration System
- **File**: `src/config/apiEndpoints.ts`
- **Purpose**: Easy switching between new and legacy endpoints
- **Default**: Uses new consolidated endpoints

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File**: `src/utils/apiErrorHandler.ts`
- **Features**: Standardized error handling across all API calls

## API Endpoint Mapping

### New Endpoints (Default)
```
GET    /users/research-members          - Get all research members
GET    /users/research-members/:id      - Get single member
GET    /users/research-members/me       - Get current user profile
PATCH  /users/research-members/:id      - Update member (admin)
PUT    /users/research-members/me       - Update own profile
DELETE /users/research-members/:id      - Delete member (admin)
```

### Legacy Endpoints (Auto-redirect)
```
GET    /researchAssociate/              → /users/research-members
GET    /researchAssociate/singleGe/:id  → /users/research-members/:id
GET    /researchAssociate/singleGet     → /users/research-members/me
PATCH  /researchAssociate/:id           → /users/research-members/:id
PUT    /researchAssociate/MembarUpdate  → /users/research-members/me
DELETE /researchAssociate/:id           → /users/research-members/:id
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Improved performance with direct endpoint calls
- ✅ Better error handling and user experience
- ✅ Full backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Easy configuration switching
- ✅ Standardized API patterns

## Testing
All existing functionality continues to work. The backend automatically redirects legacy endpoints to new ones.
