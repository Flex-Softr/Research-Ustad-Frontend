# Route Conflict Fix

## Problem

The build was failing with this error:

```
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path.
Please check /(WithDashBoadLayout)/dashboard/page and /dashboard/page.
```

## Root Cause

Both routes were resolving to `/dashboard`:

- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` â†’ `/dashboard`
- `src/app/(WithDashBoadLayout)/dashboard/page.tsx` â†’ `/dashboard`

Next.js doesn't allow two pages to resolve to the same path.

## Solution

### 1. **Removed Conflicting Routes**

- Deleted `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Deleted `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

### 2. **Updated Redirect Logic**

- Login form now redirects directly to `/(WithDashBoadLayout)/dashboard`
- Middleware handles dashboard redirects properly
- All navigation points to the correct route

### 3. **Updated Middleware**

- Added `/dashboard` to public routes for redirect handling
- Improved redirect logic for dashboard routes

## New Route Structure

```
/(WithDashBoadLayout)/dashboard â†’ Main dashboard (only route)
```

## Files Modified

1. **Deleted**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
2. **Deleted**: `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
3. **Updated**: `src/middleware.ts` - Added dashboard to public routes
4. **Updated**: `src/components/module/auth/login/components/LoginForm.tsx` - Fixed redirect path
5. **Updated**: `src/components/shared/DashboardRedirect.tsx` - Fixed redirect path

## How It Works Now

1. **User visits `/dashboard`** â†’ Middleware redirects to login
2. **User logs in** â†’ Redirects to `/(WithDashBoadLayout)/dashboard`
3. **Dashboard loads** â†’ Shows appropriate dashboard based on role

## Benefits

- âœ… **No more build errors**
- âœ… **Clean route structure**
- âœ… **Proper authentication flow**
- âœ… **Working navigation**

The route conflict is now completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
